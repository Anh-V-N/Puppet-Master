# Puppet-Master

Efficently and effortlessly create, maintain, re-use sock puppets for OSINT investigations in a consistent fashion.

## Purpose 
The goal of this project is to help OSINT investigators to easily create and store online identities (sock puppets). When adequate information of a puppet is stored, this script can automatically and consistently prepare their browser and system accordingly to each puppet.

### TODO 
- Location and timezone services.
- Keep track of last time puppet was load.
